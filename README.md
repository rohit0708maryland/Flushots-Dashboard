This dashboard is designed to provide insights into flu shot administration in 2022, tracking important metrics across different age groups, races, and geographic regions. It serves as a useful tool for healthcare providers and administrators to monitor flu shot compliance and identify areas where improvement is needed.

**Key Metrics and Visuals:**

**Flu Shots by Age:**

The dashboard tracks flu shot administration percentages across various age ranges (0-17, 18-34, 35-49, 50-64, 65+). This helps to understand which age groups have higher or lower flu shot compliance, with notable trends like the highest compliance in the 50-64 age group at 97%.

**Flu Shots by Race:**

This section provides a breakdown of flu shots by race, showing the percentage of flu shots administered to different racial groups, such as Asian, Black, Hawaiian, Native, White, and others. The data reveals that Asian individuals had the highest flu shot compliance (100%), while other groups, like Black (63.6%) and Hawaiian (66.7%), had lower compliance rates.

**Flu Shot Percentage by County:**

A geographic map visualization showcases flu shot percentages across different counties. This is useful for identifying regional disparities in flu shot distribution and helping target areas that may need more attention for vaccination drives.

**Flu Shots Over Time:**

A running total of flu shots administered is visualized across the year (from January to December). This line chart helps track the cumulative number of shots given month-by-month, providing insights into peak periods for vaccination and how compliance evolved over the year.

**Flu Shots List:**

A detailed list of individuals receiving flu shots is provided, including names and the number of shots administered. This list can be used for record-keeping and auditing purposes.

**Total Compliance Percentage:**

The overall flu shot compliance rate stands at 82.7%, representing the percentage of the target population that has received flu shots.

**Total Flu Shots Given:**

The dashboard reports that 278 flu shots were administered over the year, providing a clear figure for healthcare administrators to evaluate the scale of the vaccination campaign.
This dashboard is highly effective for healthcare professionals to track flu shot distribution and compliance across multiple dimensions, helping to ensure high vaccination rates and identify areas requiring further outreach or intervention.
